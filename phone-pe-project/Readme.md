This project is a simple data analysis dashboard created using Python, Streamlit, MySQL, Pandas, and Plotly. The purpose of this project is to analyze PhonePe transaction data and display it in an easy-to-understand visual format.

In this project, the data is stored in a MySQL database. The application connects to the database, reads the data, and shows the results using charts and graphs. Streamlit is used to build the web interface, and Plotly is used to create interactive visualizations.

The dashboard allows users to select a state, year, and quarter using sidebar filters. Based on the selection, the dashboard updates automatically and shows the related data.

The Transaction section displays total transaction amount and transaction count. It also shows transaction type analysis, quarterly growth trends, and the top-performing states. 

The Insurance section shows total insurance amount, number of policies sold, and growth over time.

The Market Expansion section displays top districts based on transaction amount and compares state performance.

The User Engagement section shows total registered users, app opens, engagement rate, and user growth trends.
